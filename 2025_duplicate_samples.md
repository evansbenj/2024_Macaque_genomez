# Duplicate samples

Sebas identified two duplicates:
105218 potentially same individual as 105177 (both Macaca nemestrina)
105170 potentially same individual as 105173 (both Macaca nemestrina)

I am going to delete the second one in each case (105177, 105173 will be deleted)



# As well these two samples have allele imbalance:
105195 Allele Imbalance
105228 Allele Imbalance and low coverage (you should not have this sample as it should have been excluded?)

I am going to include 105195 (PM544, M. togeanus) but not 105228 (M. sinica)
